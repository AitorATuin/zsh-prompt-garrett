* display full or truncated hostname on ssh
* determine the number of background jobs
* report the truncated present working directory
* report return codes other than 0
* report local time
* report the terminal line number
* report git status, git remote status, git prompt info and git SHA information
* report the currently used ruby version
* indicate vi-mode
